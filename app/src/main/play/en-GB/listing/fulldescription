Live Channels addon for Tvheadend. Pulls in DVB-T/S/C content from your Tvheadend server, including EPG, and makes it available within the Live Channels app on Nexus Player etc, or the Streaming Channels app on Sony Android TVs.

The app is open source, contributors are welcome :)

Important: A Tvheadend server is required, this app provides no content directly, relying entirely on your Tvheadend server for content.
